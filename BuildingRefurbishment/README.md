The city council of Madrid (Spain) counts with 57 empty buildings of its property. As part of the social development strategy, these buildings will be converted into cultural, entrepreneurial and education hubs over the next four years. In order to know which venues should be reconverted sooner, or what type of use should be given to each building, the council has decided to gather data on the areas where each building is located.

Once the characterisation of the areas is done, two variables will be added to help with the prioritisation of buildings:

Household income
Total population
With this data-based approach, the council will count with reliable information about the buildings and their surroundings. This project thus aims at creating visualization tools that will support the design of an implementation plan.
